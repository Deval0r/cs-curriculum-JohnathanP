 The open position is automatically calculated as 5 units forward from the door’s current position. You can customize this distance or direction based on your needs.
The isMoving flag ensures that the door moves smoothly without glitches when toggled.
The ToggleDoor() function allows the door to open or close, based on the isOpen boolean.
